## Javascript ASSIGNMENT: "Guess the Number" Game

This assignment will test your understanding of Javascript and knowledge of syntax.  
You must build a game that prompts the user to guess a randomly generated number.  
The game should keep a list of previous guesses and a tally of how many guesses have
been made. The user will have ten tries before the game is stopped and a button appears that
resets the game. The same reset button should appear if the user successfully guesses the number.
All value displays (including the input) should be reset and the input
cursor should reappear. This is also a great opportunity to practice CSS, in addition
to the HTML and Javascript that you will need!

Assignment Set up instructions (Just in case you forgot)...

## Set Up Instructions (Just in case)

1.  In your terminal command, type `npm install live-server -g`

    This will install a simple, zero-configuration command-line http server.

2.  Next you must clone a git repository that contains week one assignment instructions
    and a basic html shell for your first html/css project. There are three branches in
    the repo you will clone. The `alpha` branch will contain your assignment, with instructions
    in place of code. The `beta` will contain the completed code and serve as your answer key.
    While completing the alpha branch, simply refer to `beta` for help.

3.  Remember your Terminal Commands!

    Move to the directory you would like to clone your repo using cd (change directory)

    Clone your repo with what ever name you like typing git clone followed by the link and
    then the new name of your repo

    `git clone https://github.com/t1cgAcademy/Web-Dev-101-Week-3-Assignment.git`

    Or you can simply clone the repo and get the default name

    `git clone https://github.com/t1cgAcademy/Web-Dev-101-Week-3-Assignment.git`

    Open your cloned code in Atom or Visual Studio Code

        `atom .` or `code .`

    If the above opening command does not work, you can manually open using your graphical user interface

4)  Sanity Check!!! Change a simply html element...

5. Press `command s` on your keyboard to save the changes.

6. Now, go to your terminal command, make sure you are in your cloned git directory.

7. Now run your simple http server by typing `live-server`. Note: you must be in the projects directory.

   - When you run this command, you will see the following line... `Starting up http-server, serving ./ on: http://0.0.0.0:[someport]` This line shows the local port where your code will run.

8. Go to your browser and enter the following address with the appropriate port... `http://localhost:[someport]/`

Now you should be able to see your your changes.

Congratulations! You have just run your first HTML code. Now, get into `alpha`, follow the instructional
comments and get coding.
