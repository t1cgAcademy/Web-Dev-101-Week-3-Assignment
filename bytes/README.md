## Byte sized problems

These you can do one at a time. You'll be making changes to logic.js,
then testing the changes by running ```node test```. To see the output type
```node test -l```.

Some functions are already working, but are not using good practices. You can rewrite
them however you like, just make sure they still pass the tests.

If you want to see how your functions are working, you can do the following

type ```node```
then inside the shell type ```var logic = require('./logic.js') ```
then call your function ```square = logic.drawSquare(5) ```
and print the result ```console.log(square) ```
